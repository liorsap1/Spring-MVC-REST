How to run the application:

Download the source code.
Open in IntelliJ or other editor, build and run the project.

I put some initial data in bootstrap:

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "auth": "wpa",
        "avg_throughput": 0,
        "devices": null
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "auth": "public",
        "avg_throughput": 0,
        "devices": null
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "auth": "wpa",
        "avg_throughput": 0,
        "devices": null
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "auth": "public",
        "avg_throughput": 0,
        "devices": null
    }
]

Use postman to get, put and post.
